<h1 id="UsingOPAM">Using OPAM</h1>
<p>This document covers most of the common OPAM features. If you&#39;re looking for a
quick introduction, check the <a href='Basic_Usage.html'>Basic Usage</a> tutorial first.</p>
<p>If you are a developper and want to get a project packaged or change an existing
package, see the step-by-step <a href='Packaging.html'>packaging guide</a></p>
<p>The full documentation is available inline, using</p>
<pre><code>opam --help
opam &lt;command&gt; --help</code></pre>
<p>This document is intended as a quicker overview, use the above to dig into the
details.</p>
<h3 id="opaminit">opam init</h3>
<p>OPAM needs to initialise its internal state in a <code>~/.opam</code> directory to work.
This command can also take care of installing a version of OCaml if needed.</p>
<p>To operate as expected, some variables need to be set in your environment. You
will be prompted to update your configuration, and given instructions on how
to proceed manually if you decline.</p>
<h3 id="opamupdate">opam update</h3>
<p>This command synchronises OPAM&#39;s database with the package repositories. The
lists of available packages and their details are stored into
<code>~/.opam/repo/&lt;name&gt;</code>. Remember to run this regularly if you want to keep
up-to-date, or if you are having trouble with a package.</p>
<h3 id="Lookinguppackages">Looking up packages</h3>
<p>There are three useful commands for that:</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>opam list</code> List installed packages, or packages matching a pattern</li>
 <li><code>opam search</code> Search in package descriptions</li>
 <li><code>opam show</code> Print details on a given package.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="opaminstall">opam install</h3>
<p>This command installs packages along with all their dependencies. You can
specify one or several packages, along with version constraints. E.g:</p>
<pre><code>opam install lwt
opam install ocp-indent ocp-index.1.0.2
opam install &quot;ocamlfind&gt;=1.4.0&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="opamupgrade">opam upgrade</h3>
<p>Will attempt to upgrade the installed packages to their newest versions. You
should run it after <code>opam update</code>, and may use <code>opam pin</code> to prevent specific
packages from being upgraded.</p>
<h3 id="opamswitch">opam switch</h3>
<p>This command enables the user to have several installations on disk, each with
their own prefix, set of installed packages, and OCaml version. Use cases
include having to work or test with different OCaml versions, keeping separate
development environments for specific projects, etc.</p>
<p>Use <code>opam switch &lt;version&gt;</code> to <em>switch</em> to a different OCaml version, or <code>opam
switch &lt;name&gt; --alias-of &lt;version&gt;</code> to name the new <em>switch</em> as you like. Don&#39;t
forget to run the advertised <code>eval $(opam config env)</code> to update your PATH
accordingly.</p>
<p>Creating a new switch requires re-compiling OCaml, unless you make it an alias
of the &quot;system&quot; switch, relying on the global OCaml installation.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of specific or experimental OCaml compiler definitions on the
official repository, list them all with <code>opan switch list --all</code>.</p>
<h3 id="opampin">opam pin</h3>
<p>This command allows to pin a package to a specific version, but in fact, as you
know if you&#39;ve read the <a href='Packaging.html'>Packaging guide</a>, it can do much more.</p>
<p>The syntax is</p>
<pre><code>opam pin add &lt;package name&gt; &lt;target&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> may be a version, but also a local path, an http address or
even a git, mercurial or darcs URL. The package will be kept up-to-date with its
origin on <code>opam update</code> and when explicitely mentionned in a command, so that
you can simply run <code>opam upgrade &lt;package name&gt;</code> to re-compile it from its
upstream. If the upstream includes OPAM metadata, that will be used as well.</p>
<pre><code>opam pin add camlpdf 1.7                                      # version pin
opam pin add camlpdf ~/src/camlpdf                            # path
opam pin add opam-lib https://github.com/ocaml/opam.git#1.2   # specific branch or commit
opam pin add opam-lib --dev-repo                              # upstream repository</code></pre>
<p>This can be used in conjunction with <code>opam source</code> to start and hack an existing
package before you know it:</p>
<pre><code>opam source &lt;package&gt; --dev-repo --pin
cd &lt;package&gt;; hack hack hack;
opam upgrade &lt;package&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="opamrepo">opam repo</h3>
<p>OPAM is configured by default to use the community&#39;s software repository at
<a href='https://opam.ocaml.org'>opam.ocaml.org</a>, but this can easily be
changed at <code>opam init</code> time or later.</p>
<p><code>opam repo add &lt;name&gt; &lt;address&gt;</code> will make OPAM use the definitions of any
package versions defined at <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>, falling back to the previously defined
repositories for those which aren&#39;t defined. The <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> may point to an
http, local or version-controlled repository.</p>
<p>Defining your own repository, either locally or online, is quite easy: you can
start off by cloning <a href='https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository'>the official
repository</a> if you intend it as a
replacement, or just create a new directory with <code>packages</code> and <code>compilers</code>
sub-directories. See the <a href='Packaging.html'>packaging guide</a> if you need help on
the package format.</p>
<p>If your repository is going to be served over HTTP, you should generate an index
using the <code>opam-admin</code> tool.</p>
