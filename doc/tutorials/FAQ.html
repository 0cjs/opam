<h4 id="HowtogetinstallandupgradeOPAM">→ How to get, install and upgrade OPAM ?</h4>
<p>See the <a href='Quick_Install.html'>Quick install guide</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Whereisthemanual">→ Where is the manual ?</h4>
<p>OPAM has git-like, hierarchical manpages. Try <code>opam --help</code> for a starting point.</p>
<p>Get started with OPAM packages by reading the <a href='Packaging.html'>Packaging Howto</a>.</p>
<p>See the details on the file formats and more in the <a href='https://github.com/ocaml/opam/blob/master/doc/dev-manual/dev-manual.pdf?raw=true'>Developper
Guide</a>
(pdf).</p>
<h4 id="WhatchangesdoesOPAMdotomyfilesystem">→ What changes does OPAM do to my filesystem ?</h4>
<p>OPAM is designed to be run strictly as user (non-root), and apart for the
explicit options provided during <code>opam init</code>, only writes within <code>~/.opam</code> (and
<code>/tmp</code>). This directory -- the default &quot;OPAM root&quot; -- contains configuration,
various internal data, a cache of downloaded archives, and your OCaml
installations.</p>
<h4 id="Whydoesopaminitneedtoaddstufftomyinitscriptswhyisevalopamconfigenvneeded">→ Why does <code>opam init</code> need to add stuff to my init scripts / why is <code>eval $(opam config env)</code> needed ?</h4>
<p>You need two things when you install OPAM packages: to have their libraries
accessible, and to access binary programs. To provide those, OPAM needs to setup
a few ocaml-related environment variables, and to prepend to your PATH variable.</p>
<p>Of course, you may choose not to let OPAM change anything at <code>opam init</code>, and
run <code>eval $(opam config env)</code> yourself whenever you will be needing it.</p>
<h4 id="Whatisaquotswitchquot">→ What is a &quot;switch&quot; ?</h4>
<p>An ocaml installation and a set of installed packages within an OPAM
installation. This can be used to keep different OCaml versions side-by-side, or
different sets of packages. See the <a href='Advanced_Usage.html#opamswitch'>related
section</a> in the Advanced usage manual and
<code>opam switch --help</code>. The &quot;prefix&quot; for a given installation is simply
<code>~/.opam/&lt;switch-name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>A switch is either based on a system-wide OCaml installation, or on a local
installation. In the former case, OPAM will need to recompile all packages when
your system compiler changes. In the latter case, OCaml will be downloaded and
compiled on creation of the switch.</p>
<h4 id="CanIworkondifferentswitchesatthesametimeindifferentshells">→ Can I work on different switches at the same time in different shells ?</h4>
<p>Yes. Use one of:</p>
<pre><code>eval $(opam config env --switch &lt;switch&gt;)     # for the current shell
opam config exec --switch &lt;switch&gt; &lt;command&gt;  # for one command</code></pre>
<p>This only affects the environment.</p>
<h4 id="CanIgetanewswitchwiththesamepackagesinstalled">→ Can I get a new switch with the same packages installed ?</h4>
<p>Yes. Use:</p>
<pre><code>opam switch export file.export  # from the previous switch
opam switch &lt;new switch&gt;
opam switch import file.export</code></pre>
<p>OPAM might fail if you had packages installed that are not compatible with the
OCaml version in your new switch. In that case, you&#39;ll need to remove them from
the <code>file.export</code> file by hand (the format is straight-forward, one line per
package).</p>
<h4 id="IinstalledapackagebyhandusedocamlfindremovefiddledwiththeinstalledpackagesandOPAMisoutofsyncHelp">→ I installed a package by hand / used <code>ocamlfind remove</code> / fiddled with the installed packages and OPAM is out of sync. Help !</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t panic. OPAM assumes it&#39;s controlling what&#39;s below <code>~/.opam/&lt;switch&gt;</code>, but
there are several ways you can recover:</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>opam remove --force</code> will attempt to uninstall even if not registered as
 installed. Then <code>opam install</code></li>
 <li><code>opam reinstall</code> will try to remove an installed package, but go on to
 re-installing even if that fails.</li>
 <li>If all else fails, you can re-install your current set of packages from
 scratch using <code>opam switch reinstall</code></li>
 <li>You can force OPAM to register an installation or removal <em>without actually
 performing anything</em> using <code>opam install|remove --fake</code>. This is not
 recommended though, as your manual install may not be exactly equivalent to
 the one expected by other OPAM packages, and OPAM may later on trigger
 reinstallations or upgrades of the package. Don&#39;t complain if you mess up your
 installation using this! If you want to control how a package is installed or
 modify it, the right way is <code>opam pin</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Whataretheminimumrequirements">→ What are the minimum requirements ?</h4>
<p>1GB of memory should be all you need. It was reported that you may run into
problems with 512MB of RAM and no swap. Of course, software packages themselves
may be more greedy.</p>
<h4 id="Somepackagefailduringcompilationcomplainingaboutmissingdependenciesquotm4quotquotlibgtkquotetc">→ Some package fail during compilation, complaining about missing dependencies (&quot;m4&quot;, &quot;libgtk&quot;, etc.)</h4>
<p>They probably depend on system, non-OCaml libraries: you&#39;ll need to install them
using your system package manager (apt-get, yum, pacman, homebrew, etc.). If you
have no idea what the missing system package might be:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Check for hints printed by the failing package</li>
 <li>Check the output of <code>opam list &lt;package&gt; --external</code></li>
 <li>Lookup the development packages corresponding to the error in your system&#39;s
 package repositories. If you got to this point and found the appropriate
 packages, we&#39;d be glad if you could tell us your system details and the answer
 in <a href='https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues'>the opam-repository
 tracker</a>, to save the others
 the trouble of searching. Thanks.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Ihaveweirdchecksumerrorswheredotheycomefrom">→ I have weird checksum errors: where do they come from ?</h4>
<p>First of all, you should make sure your repositories are up-to-date:</p>
<pre><code>opam update</code></pre>
<p>If this isn&#39;t enough, or if you get the checksum errors while running <code>opam
init</code>, this could be caused by a badly configured proxy cache that is serving
stale files. To clear your proxy cache, you can use <code>wget --no-cache
&lt;remote-file&gt;</code> and retry.</p>
<p>As a last resort, you can bypass the checksum checks using <code>--no-checksums</code>.</p>
<h4 id="OPAMispromptingmetoinstallorupgradepackagesthatIamnotinterestedinordoesn39tinstallthelatestversionbydefaultWhyWhatcanIdo">→ OPAM is prompting me to install or upgrade packages that I am not interested in, or doesn&#39;t install the latest version by default. Why ? What can I do ?</h4>
<ul>
 <li>You can be more explicit in your request (<code>opam upgrade PACKAGES</code>, <code>opam
  install &#39;PACKAGE&gt;=VERSION&#39; PACKAGE...</code>, etc.)</li>
 <li>Action resolution in a package set is known to be a NP-complete problem; OPAM
 uses state-of-the-art algorithms through an external, dedicated solver: make
 sure you have the latest version of <a href='http://potassco.sourceforge.net/'>aspcud</a>
 installed.</li>
 <li>Another benefit of the external solvers is that they allow to be <a href='Specifying_Solver_Preferences.html'>quite
 expressive</a> on your expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="WheredoIreportBugsIssuesandFeatureRequests">→ Where do I report Bugs, Issues and Feature Requests?</h4>
<ul>
 <li><p>Bug reports and feature requests for the OPAM tool should be reported on
<a href='https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues'>OPAM&#39;s issue-tracker</a>.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Packaging issues or requests for a new package can be reported on the
<a href='https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues'>official repository&#39;s
issue-tracker</a>.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>General queries for both the tool and the packages can be addressed on the
<a href='http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform'>OCaml-platform mailing-list</a> and
insights and evolution of OPAM internals can discussed on the <a href='http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opam-devel'>OPAM-devel
mailing-list</a>.</p>
