# The <span class="opam">opam</span> manual

This manual gathers reference information on <span class="opam">opam</span> and its file formats. It is
primarily of use for packagers, package maintainers and repository maintainers.

* For simple usage of <span class="opam">opam</span>, see the [Usage](Usage.html) page, and the
  comprehensive built-in documentation `opam [command] --help`.
* For a gentler introduction to packaging, see the
  [Packaging guide](Packaging.html)
* If you want to hack on <span class="opam">opam</span> or build related tools, the API documentation can
  be browsed [here](api/index.html)

## File hierarchies

### opam root

<span class="opam">opam</span> holds its configuration, metadata, logs, temporary directories and caches
within a directory that we will call _opam root_. By default, this is `~/.opam`,
and we may refer to it by this name in this manual for the sake of simplicity,
but this can be changed using the `OPAMROOT` environment variable or the
`--root` command-line argument.

An existing <span class="opam">opam</span> root is required for <span class="opam">opam</span> to operate normally, and one is
created upon running `opam init`. The initial configuration can be defined
through a configuration file at `~/.opamrc`, `/etc/opam` or at a location
specified through the `--config` command-line option. If none is present, <span class="opam">opam</span>
defaults to its built-in configuration that binds to the OCaml repository at
`https://opam.ocaml.org`.

Except in explicit cases, <span class="opam">opam</span> only alters files within its <span class="opam">opam</span> root. It is
organised as follows:
- [`~/.opam/config`](#config): the global <span class="opam">opam</span> configuration file
- `~/.opam/repo/`: contains the mirrors of the configured package repositories
- [`~/.opam/repo/repos-config`](#reposconfig): lists the configured package repositories and their URLs
- `~/.opam/repo/<repo>`: mirror of the given repository
- `~/.opam/opam-init/`: contains <span class="opam">opam</span> configuration scripts for the outside world, e.g. shell environment initialisation
- `~/.opam/cache/`: caches of downloaded files
- `~/.opam/plugins/<plugin>`: reserved for plugins
- `~/.opam/<switch>`: prefixes of named [switches](#switches)

### Repositories

Repositories are collection of <span class="opam">opam</span> package definitions. They respect the
following hierarchy:
- [`/repo`](#repo): repository configuration file
- [`/packages/<pkgname>/<pkgname>.<version>/opam`](#opam): holds the metadata
  for the given package. `url` and `descr` may also be present, in which case
  they override what may already be present in the `opam` file
- [`/packages/<pkgname>/<pkgname>.<version>/files/`](#files): contains files to copy over
  the source of the given package before it gets used
- `/archives/<pkgname>.<version>+opam.tar.gz`: cached package archives
  (as generated by running `opam-admin make`)
- `/urls.txt`, `/index.tar.gz`: index files useful when serving over HTTP, they
  can be generated using `opam-admin make --index`

<span class="opam">opam</span> can be configured to use repositories at local or remote (ssh) paths, HTTP
URLs, or on version control systems. A repository is set up using

```
opam repository add <name> <URL>
```

and can subsequently be then selected for use in specific switches using `opam
repository select <name>`. Use `opam repository list --all` for an overview of
configured repositories. Repository selection is always ordered, with the
definition of a given version of a package being taken from the repository with
the lowest index where it is found.

Data from the configured repositories is updated from the upstreams manually
using the `opam update` command.

### Switches

<span class="opam">opam</span> is designed to hold any number of concurrent installation prefixes, called
_switches_. Switches are isolated from each other and have their own set of
installed packages, selection of repositories, and configuration options. All
package-related commands operate on a single switch, and require one to be
selected.

The current switch can be selected in the following ways:
- globally, using `opam switch <switch>`. <span class="opam">opam</span> will use that switch for all
  further commands, except when overriden in one of the following ways.
- for local switches, which are external to the opam root, when in the directory
  where the switch resides or a descendant.
- through the `--switch <switch>` command-line flag, for a single command.
- by setting the `OPAMSWITCH=<switch>` environment variable, to set it within a
  single shell session. This can be done by running `eval $(opam config env
  --switch <switch>)` to set the shell environment at once, see below.

Switches have their own prefix, normally `~/.opam/<switch>`, where packages get
intalled ; to use what is installed in a switch, some environment variables need
to be set, _e.g._ to make executables installed into `~/.opam/<switch>/bin`
visible, that directory needs to be added to `PATH`, but individual packages can
define their own settings as well.

Command `opam config env` returns the environment updates corresponding to the
current switch, in a format readable by your shell, and when needed <span class="opam">opam</span> will
prompt you to run:

```
eval $(opam config env)
```

A switch is created using `opam switch create <switch> (<compiler>|--empty)`.
- `<switch>` can be either a plain name, or a directory name (if containing `/`
  or starting with `.`). In the latter case the switch is _local_ and instead of
  being held at `~/.opam/<switch>`, it will be created in the given directory,
  as a `_opam` subdirectory. Local switches are automatically selected depending
  on the current directory, see above.
- If a `<compiler>` is selected, <span class="opam">opam</span> will install the corresponding packages
  and their dependencies in the new switch. These packages will be marked as
  _base_, protected against removal and unaffected by upgrade commands.
  `<compiler>` can be selected among packages which have the `compiler` flag
  set, or their versions. Use `opam switch list-available` to list them.

#### Structure

If we define `<switch-prefix>` as:
- `~/.opam/<switch>` for plain switches
- `<switch>/_opam` for local switches, when `<switch>` is a path

Switches are laid out thusly:
- `<switch-prefix>/`: prefix of the switch, holding the installation hierarchy
  in the UNIX `/usr` standard (with subdirectories `bin`, `lib`, `share`, `man`,
  `doc`, `etc`...)
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/`: holds all <span class="opam">opam</span> data regarding this switch
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-config`](#switchconfig): switch-specific
  configuration
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-state`](#switchstate): stores the sets
  of installed, base, pinned packages
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/environment`: contains the environment variable
  settings for this switch
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/reinstall`: list of packages marked for
  reinstallation (development packages where changes have been detected)
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/config/<pkgname>.config`](#ltpkgnamegtconfig):
  installed package's, opam specific configuration
- [`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/install/<pkgname>.install`](#ltpkgnamegtinstall):
  `.install` files used to install the given package
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/install/<pkgname>.changes`: file changes done by
  the installation of the given package, as tracked by <span class="opam">opam</span>
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/packages/<pkgname>.<version>/`: metadata of the
  given package as it has been used for its installation
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/packages.dev/<pkgname>/`: sources (archives or
  VC clones) of the given packages, when not fetched from the repository
  directly
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/overlay/<pkgname>/`: custom definition for the
  given pinned packages
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/build/<pkgname>.<version>/`: temporary
  directories where the packages are compiled
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/remove/<pkgname>.<version>/`: temporary
  directories used for calling the packages' `remove` commands, when those need
  the source.
- `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/backup`: snapshots of previous states of the
  switch, and other backup files.

#### Pinning

Pinning is an operation by which a package definition can be created or altered
locally in a switch.

In its most simple form, `opam pin <package>`, `<package>` is bound to its
current version and won't be changed on `opam upgrade` (assuming it is an
existing package).

`opam pin` can further be used to divert the source of a package, or even create
a new package, using `opam pin <package> <URL>` ; this is also very useful to
point to a local path containing a development or patched version of the package
source. If the source you are pointing to contains a matching `<pkgname>.opam/`
or `opam/` directory, a matching `<pkgname>.opam` or `opam` file, that will be
used as the initial package metadata.

Whenever an install, reinstall or upgrade command-line refers to a pinned
package, <span class="opam">opam</span> first fetches its latest source. `opam update` otherwise updates
its cache of all the packages pinned in the current switch.

## Common file format

### Conventions

Syntax is given in a BNF-like notation. Non-terminals are written `<like this>`,
terminals are either plain text or written in double-quotes (`"terminal"`),
curly brackets denote zero or more repetitions when suffixed with `*`, or one or
more when suffixed with `+`, and square brackets denote zero or one occurence.
Parentheses are for grouping.

As a special case, and for readability, we add simplified notations for _lists_
and _options_:
- `[ <list-contents> ... ]` means
  `"[" { <list-contents> } "]" | <list-contents>`.
  It corresponds to a case of the `<list>` non-terminal and is a list of
  `<list-contents>` repeated any number of times. The square brackets can be
  omitted when `<list-contents>` occurs just once.
- `<element> { <opt> }` means
  `<element> [ "{" <opt> "}" ]`.
  It corresponds to a specific case of the `<option>` non-terminal.

### General syntax

```BNF
<file-contents> ::= { <file-item> }*
<file-item>     ::= <field-binding> | <section>
<field-binding> ::= <ident> : <value>
<section>       ::= <ident> [ <string> ] "{" <file-contents> "}"
<ident>         ::= ( <letter> | "_" ) { <letter> | <digit> | "_" | "-" }*
<varident>      ::= [ <ident> { "+" <ident> }* : ] <ident>
<letter>        ::= "a".."z" | "A".."Z"
<digit>         ::= "0".."9"
<value>         ::= <bool> | <int> | <string> | <ident> | <varident> | <operator> | <list> | <option> | "(" <value> ")"
<bool>          ::= true | false
<int>           ::= [ "-" ] { <digit> }+
<string>        ::= ( " { <char> }* " ) | ( """ { <char> }* """ )
<operator>      ::= { "!" | "=" | "<" | ">" | "|" | "&" }+ | [ ":" ] <operator> [ ":" ]
<list>          ::= "[" { <value> }* "]"
<option>        ::= <value> "{" { <value> }* "}"
<comment>       ::= ( "(*" { <char> }* "*)" ) | ( "#" { <char\newline> }* <newline> )
```

The <span class="opam">opam</span> file formats share a common base syntax. The files are utf8 encoded and
define a list of _fields_ and _sections_.

<span class="opam">opam</span> uses a range of different files, each allowing their own set of fields and
sections, in a specific format.

Base values can be literal booleans, integers or strings, identifiers, and
operators. Strings allow the escapes `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\b`, `\t`, as well
as three-digit decimal and two-digit hexadecimal character codes (`\NNN` and
`\xNN`), and escaped newlines. As a special case, they can be enclosed in triple
double-quotes (`"""`), so that single quotes don't need to be escaped. Lists
must be enclosed in square brackets unless they contain a single element. Values
can be followed by an argument in braces. Parentheses may be used to group
sub-expressions.

<table class="table">
<thead><tr> <th>type</th> <th>format</th> <th>example</th> </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr> <td>bool</td> <td><code>true|false</code></td> <td><code>true</code></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>int</td> <td><code>-?[0-9]+</code></td> <td><code>42</code></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>string</td> <td><code>"..."</code></td> <td><code>"a string"</code></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>ident</td> <td><code>[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9:_+-]*</code></td> <td><code>foo</code></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>operator</td> <td><code>[!=&lt;&gt;|&amp;+:]+</code></td> <td><code>&gt;=</code></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>list</td> <td> <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> or <code>[ &lt;value&gt; &lt;value&gt; ... ]</code> </td> <td><code>[ foo "bar" ]</code></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>option</td> <td> <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;value&gt; { &lt;value&gt; &lt;value&gt; ... }</code> </td> <td><code>foo { &gt; "0" }</code></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>parens</td> <td><code>(&lt;value&gt;)</code></td> <td><code>(foo &amp; bar)</code></td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Comments may be either enclosed in `(*` and `*)`, or `#` and newline. They are
ignored by <span class="opam">opam</span>.


### Package Formulas

Package formulas are used to express requirements on the set of installed
packages.

```BNF
<package-formula> ::= <package-formula> <logop> <package-formula>
                    | ( <package-formula> )
                    | <pkgname> { { <version-formula> }* }
<logop>           ::= "&" | "|"
<pkgname>         ::= <string>
<version-formula> ::= <version-formula> <logop> <version-formula>
                    | "!" <version-formula>
                    | "(" <version-formula> ")"
                    | <relop> <version>
<relop>           ::= "=" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
<version>         ::= <string>
```

Both package names and versions are encoded as strings. We are using logic
formulas with the operators `&` and `|` for AND and OR, over package names. `&`
is higher priority than `|`, so the parentheses in this example are required:

```
("neat_package" | "also_neat_package") & "required_package"
```

Package names can be suffixed with _version constraints_, which restricts the
requirement further. Version constraints have the form `<relop> <version>` and
can be combined with binary AND `&` and OR `|`, and prefix NOT `!`. The allowed
relational operators are `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`, and their meaning
is defined by Version Ordering. They always have higher priority than logical
operators.

> <a id="version-ordering">**Version Ordering**</a> follows the basics of the
> [Debian definition](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version).
>
> It is basically "lexicographical order, with numbers handled
> properly". In more detail (see the [Debian
> page](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version)
> for full details):
>
> - Version strings are sliced into alternate, possibly empty non-digit / digit
>   sequences, always starting with a non-digit sequence. `1.0~beta2` is thus
>   `["";1;".";0;"~beta";2]`.
>
> - Those sequences are sorted lexicographically. Because of the split
>   as `non-digit; digit; non-digit; ...`, non-digit sequences are
>   always compared to non-digit sequences (and conversely). For
>   example, the versions `a` and `1` are sliced into `["a"]` and
>   `[""; 1]`, so we have `1 < a` because the non-digit component of
>   1, which is the empty string `""`, is smaller than `"a"`.
>
> - For non-digit components, the ordering used is that letters are
>   always smaller than non-letters (for example `z` < `"#"`), while
>   non-letters are compared by ASCII order.
>
> - The `~` character is special as it sorts even before the end of sequence
>   (_i.e._ before anything shorter: "~" sorts before "", "a~b" before "a").
>   It's most convenient for pre-releases, allowing `1.0~beta` to be before
>   `1.0`.
>
> Here is an example of an ordered sequence: `~~`, `~`, `~beta2`, `~beta10`,
> `0.1`, `1.0~beta`, `1.0`, `1.0-test`, `1.0.1`, `1.0.10`, `dev`, `trunk`.

Here is a full example:

```
"foo" { >= "3.12" } & ("bar" | "baz" { !(> "2" & < "3.5") & != "5.1" })
```

### Variables

#### Usage

Variables may appear at a few different places in <span class="opam">opam</span> files and configuration.
They can be used in two forms:

- raw idents: `foo < bar`
- within strings, using _interpolation_, when enclosed in `%{` and `}%`:
  `"%{foo}%/bar"`

For both forms, and within values that allow them, the variables are replaced by
their contents, if any, just before the value is used. Variable contents can be
either _strings_, _booleans_ or _undefined_, and automatic conversion may take
place using the strings `"true"` and `"false"` (leading to an _undefined_ bool
when converting from any other string). Undefined values are propagated through
boolean expressions, and lead otherwise to context-dependent default values (the
empty string or `false`, depending on the expected type, unless specified
otherwise).

The syntax`"%{var?string-if-true:string-if-false-or-undefined}%"` can be used to
insert different strings depending on the boolean value of a variable.

Additionally, boolean package variables may be combined using the following
form: `name1+name2+name3:var` is the conjunction of `var` for each of `name1`,
`name2` and `name3`, _i.e_ it is equivalent to `name1:var & name2:var &
name3:var`

#### Scopes

The defined variables depend on the specific fields being defined. There are
three scopes:

1. Global variables correspond to the general current configuration, or to the
   current switch settings (system setup, <span class="opam">opam</span> configuration, current switch
   name, etc.). For example `opam-version`, `arch`, or `make`.
2. Package variables have the form `package-name:var-name` and contain values
   specific to a given package, for example `foo:installed` is a boolean
   variable that can be used to check if package `foo` is installed, and
   `foo:lib` is its library installation directory. The prefix `package-name:`
   can be replaced by `_:` within the package's own <span class="opam">opam</span> file, or simply omitted
   when not shadowed by another variable. In this case, the variable always
   relates to the version of the package being defined. Otherwise, `foo:bar`
   always refers to `bar` in the installed version of `foo`, and may be
   undefined if `foo` is not installed.
3. Some fields define their own local variables, like `success` in the field
   [`post-messages`](#opamfield-post-messages)

For a comprehensive list of predefined variables, and their current local
values, run:

```
opam config list
```

### Filters

_Filters_ are formulas based on variables. Their main use is as optional
conditions to commands or command arguments, using the postfix-braces syntax:

```
[ "./configure" "--use-foo" {foo:installed} ]
```

In build instructions, this adds condition `foo:installed` to the `"--use-foo"`
argument, which will cause it to be omitted unless the variable `foo:installed`
is `true`. This is evaluated just when the command is going to be run.

```BNF
<filter> ::= <filter> <logop> <filter>
           | "!" <filter>
           | ( <filter> )
           | <filter> <relop> <filter>
           | <varident>
           | <string>
           | <bool>
```

Filters are evaluated at a certain point in time, and should not be mistaken
with package formulas, which express requirements.

The following are allowed in filters:
- String and boolean literals
- Idents
- Parentheses
- Logical operators (binary AND `&`, binary OR `|`, prefix, unary NOT `!`)
- Binary relational operators (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`)

The comparisons are done using [Version Order](#version-ordering). Relational
operators have a higher precedence than logical operators.

Undefined values are propagated through relational operators, and logical
operators unless absorbed (`undef & false` is `false`, `undef | true` is
`true`).

### Filtered package formulas

This extension to package formulas allows variables to be referenced within
version constraints, and parts of the formula to be made optional. This is
evaluated as a first pass, before any action is taken, to deduce a concrete
package formula.

The definition is similar to that of `<package-formula>`, except that two cases
`<filter>` and `<relop> <filter>` ar added to `<version-formula>`

```BNF
<filtered-package-formula> ::= <filtered-package-formula> <logop> <filtered-package-formula>
                             | ( <filtered-package-formula> )
                             | <pkgname> { { <filtered-version-formula> }* }

<filtered-version-formula> ::= <filtered-version-formula> <logop> <filtered-version-formula>
                             | "!" <filtered-version-formula>
                             | "(" <filtered-version-formula> ")"
                             | <relop> <version>
                             | <filter>
                             | <relop> <filter>
```

For example, a dependency on `"foo" { = version }` will require package `foo` at
the version defined by variable `version` (which is the version of the package
being defined). Conditions can be added using the same logical operators present
in pure package formulas, so one can also write `"foo" { >= "3.12" & build }`,
which makes the dependency dependent on the boolean value of the variable
`build`.

When the version formula reduces to `false`, as would be the case here when
`build=false`, the dependency is removed from the formula.

### Interpolation

Some files can be rewritten using variable interpolation expansion: in cases
where this is available, when looking for `file` and `file.in` is found, any
`%{var}%` interpolations found in it are replaced by the contents of `var` and
the results are written back to `file`.

This can also be done explicitly using the command `opam config subst "file"`.

### Environment updates

Some fields define updates to environment variables in the form:

```
<ident> <update-op> <string>
```

The allowed update operators `update-op` denote how the string is applied to the
environment variable:
- `=` override (or set if undefined)
- `+=` prepend (or set if undefined)
- `=+` append (or set if undefined)
- `:=` prepend (or set to if undefined) `<string>:`
- `=:` append (or set to if undefined) `:<string>`

### URLs

URLs are provided as strings. They can refer to:
- raw local filesystem paths
- ssh addresses `user@host:path`
- URLs of the form `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, `ssh://`, `file://`, `rsync://`
- Version control URLs for git, mercurial and darcs: `git://`, `hg://`,
  `darcs://`. This assumes http transport for `hg` and `darcs`, _i.e._
  `hg://` is short for `hg+http://`
- Version control bound to a specific URL: `<vc>+<scheme>://`, e.g. `git://`,
  `hg+https://`, `git+file://`, etc. (**NOTE:** this has been added in <span class="opam">opam</span> 1.2.1)

> Backwards-compatibility note: to allow unambiguous urls, e.g. for the
> `dev-repo` field, without triggering a failure on <span class="opam">opam</span> 1.2.0, you should use
> the compatible syntax `<vc>://<scheme>://`, e.g. `hg://https://` at the
> moment. This will get rewritten to the nicer `<vc>+<scheme>://` in the next
> repository format upgrade.

In addition, version control URLs may be suffixed with the `#` character and a
reference name (branch, commit, HEAD...): `git://foo.com/git/bar#master`,
`hg+file://foo.com/hg/bar#dev1`

The URLs given for user information (e.g. package homepages and bugtrackers) are
not concerned and should just load nice in common browsers.

## Specific file formats

This section describes the precise file formats of the different kinds of files
used by <span class="opam">opam</span>.

### Public configuration files

These files are intended to be publicly distributed as part of public
repositories or initial distributions or packages.

#### repo
<a id="Repospecification"></a>

The `repo` file is placed at the root of a repository, and allows to specify
some specifics of the repository. It has the following optional fields:

* <a id="repofield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  File format and repository format version, should be `2.0` as of writing.
* <a id="repofield-browse">`browse: <string>`</a>:
  An URL where the users may browse available packages online
* <a id="repofield-upstream">`upstream: <string>`</a>:
  The source that this repo is generated and maintained from. Typically, a
  version-control system address.
* <a id="repofield-redirect">`redirect: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  List of URLs to (permanently) redirect to if their filters evaluate to `true`.
  Can be used to serve different repositories for different OSes or different
  versions of <span class="opam">opam</span>.

#### opamrc

This file has a format close to that of [config](#config), and can be used to
define an initial setup for <span class="opam">opam</span>. When running `opam init`, if `~/.opamrc` or
`/etc/opam` is present, or if `--config` was specified, the configuration
options from that file will be used, overriding the defaults.

The default, built-in initial config of <span class="opam">opam</span> can be seen with `opam init
--help`.

- <a id="opamrcfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version.
- <a id="opamrcfield-repositories">`repositories: [ "[" <string> <url> "]" ... ]`</a>:
  preconfigured repository names and their corresponding URLs.
- <a id="opamrcfield-default-compiler">`default-compiler: [ <package-formula> ... ]`</a>:
  a list of compiler package choices. On `opam init`, the first available
  compiler in the list will be chosen for creating the initial switch if
  `--bare` wasn't specified.
- [`jobs:`](#configfield-jobs),
  [`download-command:`](#configfield-download-command),
  [`download-jobs:`](#configfield-download-jobs),
  [`solver-criteria:`](#configfield-solver-criteria),
  [`solver-upgrade-criteria:`](#configfield-solver-upgrade-criteria),
  [`solver-fixup-criteria:`](#configfield-solver-fixup-criteria),
  [`solver:`](#configfield-solver),
  [`global-variables:`](#configfield-global-variables):
  these have the same format as the same-named fields in the [config](#config)
  file, and will be imported to that file on `opam init`.

#### switch-config

This file is located in `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-config` and
contains configuration options specific to that switch:

- <a id="switchconfigfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version.
- <a id="switchconfigfield-synopsis">`synopsis: <string>`</a>:
  a short description for the switch, shown when listing. By default, this is
  initialised to the synopsis of the chosen compiler package.
- <a id="switchconfigfield-repos">`repositories: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  lists the repositories in use in this switch, higher priority first. The
  repository names should correspond to configured repositories in
  `~/.opam/repo` (they are otherwise ignored). If unset, the
  [set of repositories](#configfield-repositories) from the global configuration
  is used.
- <a id="switchconfigfield-opam-root">`opam-root: <string>`</a>:
  the opam root the switch belongs to. Used for local switches, to avoid
  automatically selecting a switch belonging to a different opam root.
- [`pre-build-commands:`](#configfield-pre-build-commands),
  [`pre-install-commands:`](#configfield-pre-install-commands),
  [`pre-remove-commands:`](#configfield-pre-remove-commands):
  as the corresponding [global config](#config) fields.
- [`wrap-build-commands:`](#configfield-pre-build-commands),
  [`wrap-install-commands:`](#configfield-pre-install-commands),
  [`wrap-remove-commands:`](#configfield-pre-remove-commands):
  as the corresponding [global config](#config) fields.
- [`post-build-commands:`](#configfield-pre-build-commands),
  [`post-install-commands:`](#configfield-pre-install-commands),
  [`post-remove-commands:`](#configfield-pre-remove-commands):
  as the corresponding [global config](#config) fields.
- <a id="switchconfigsection-paths">`paths: "{" { <ident>: <string> ... } "}"`</a>:
  defines the standard paths within the switch: recognised fields include
  `prefix:`, `bin:`, `sbin:`, `lib:`, `share:`, `etc:`, `doc:`, `man:`,
  `stublibs:`, `toplevel:`.
- <a id="switchconfigsection-variables">`variables: "{" { <ident>: <string> ... } "}"`</a>:
  allows the definition of variables local to the switch.

### Package definitions

Package definitions can be a single [`opam`](#opam) file, with optional
[`descr`](#descr) and [`url`](#url) files besides it. A [`files/`](#files)
subdirectory can also be used to add files over the package source.

[`<pkgname>.install`](#ltpkgnamegtinstall) and
[`<pkgname>.config`](#ltpkgnamegtconfig), on the other hand, are metadata files
used by opam but that are found in the package source directory, after it has
been built.

#### opam

Package definition files, specifying a package's metadata. Usage of the `opam
lint` command is recommended to check the validity and quality of your `opam`
files.

`opam` files allow the following fields and sections:

- <a id="opamfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a> (mandatory):
  the file format version, should be `2.0` as of writing.

- <a id="opamfield-name">`name: <pkgname>`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-version">`version: <version>`</a>:
  the name and version of the package. Both fields are optional when they can be
  inferred from the directory name (e.g. when the file sits in the repository),
  but should always be set for package definitions within source trees.

- <a id="opamfield-maintainer">`maintainer: [ <string> ... ]`</a> (mandatory):
  A contact address for the package maintainer (the format `"name <email>"` is
  allowed).

- <a id="opamfield-authors">`authors: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  a list of strings listing the original authors of the software.

- <a id="opamfield-license">`license: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  the abbreviated name(s) of the license(s) under which the source software is
  available.

- <a id="opamfield-homepage">`homepage: [ <string> ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-doc">`doc: [ <string> ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-bug-reports">`bug-reports: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  URLs pointing to the related pages for the package, for user information

- <a id="opamfield-dev-repo">`dev-repo: <string>`</a>:
  the URL of the package's source repository, which may be useful for
  developers: not to be mistaken with the URL file, which points to the
  specific packaged version.

- <a id="opamfield-tags">`tags: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  an optional list of semantic tags used to classify the packages. The
  `"org:foo"` tag is reserved for packages officially distributed by
  organization ``foo''.

- <a id="opamfield-patches">`patches: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  a list of files relative to the project source root (often added through the
  `files/` metadata subdirectory). The listed patch files will be applied
  sequentially to the source as with the `patch` command. Variable interpolation
  is available, so you can specify `patches: [ "file" ]` to have the patch
  processed from `file.in`.

    Patches may be applied conditionally by adding _filters_.

- <a id="opamfield-substs">`substs: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  a list of files relative to the project source root. These files will be
  generated from their `.in` counterparts, with variable interpolations
  expanded.

- <a id="opamfield-build">
  `build: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the list of commands that will be run in order to compile the package.

    Each command is provided as a list of terms (a command and zero or more
    arguments) ; individual terms as well as full commands can be made
    conditional by adding filters: they will be ignored if the filter evaluates
    to `false` or is undefined. Variable interpolations are also evaluated.
    These commands will be executed in sequence, from the root of a fresh
    package source tree.

    The commands executed during the `build:` stage may write exclusively to
    this source tree, should be non-interactive and should perform no network
    i/o. All libraries, syntax extensions, binaries, platform-specific
    configuration and `package-name.config` or `package-name.install` files are
    expected to be produced within the source directory subtree, _i.e._ below
    the command's `$PWD`, during this step.

- <a id="opamfield-install">
  `install: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the list of commands that will be run in order to install the package.

    This field follows the exact same format as `build:`. It is used to move
    products of `build:` from the build directory to their final destination
    under the current `prefix`, and do any required additional setup. Commands
    in `install:` are executed sequentially, from the root of the source tree
    from where the `build:` commands have been run. These commands should only
    write to subdirectories of `prefix`, without altering the source directory
    itself.

    This field contains typically just `[make "install"]`. If a
    `package-name.install` is found at the source of the build directory, <span class="opam">opam</span>
    will install files from there to the prefix according to its instructions
    after calling the commands specified in the `install:` field have been run.

- <a id="opamfield-build-doc">
  `build-doc: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="opamfield-build-test">
  `build-test: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the list of commands to build documentation and tests. They are processed
  after the build phase when documentation or tests have been requested. These
  follow the same specification as the [`build:`](#opamfield-build) field.

- <a id="opamfield-remove"> `remove: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] { <filter>
  } ... ]`</a>: commands to run before removing the package, in the same format
  as `build:` and `install:`.
  As of `2.0`, <span class="opam">opam</span> tracks the files added to the prefix during package
  installation, and automatically removes them on package removal, so this
  should not be needed anymore in most cases (and may even be harmful if files
  from different packages overlap, which remove scripts generally don't handle).
  Use it for special actions, like reverting updates to files, or stopping
  daemons: removing what was just added is alredy taken care of.

    The commands are run from the root of a fresh copy of the package source,
    unless the [`light-uninstall`](#opamflag-light-uninstall) package flag is
    present, in which case they are run from the prefix.

- <a id="opamfield-depends">`depends: [ <filtered-package-formula> ... ]`</a>:
  the package dependencies. This describes the requirements on other packages
  for this package to be built and installed. It contains a list of package
  formulas, understood as a conjunction.

    The filtered package formula can access the global and switch variables, but
    not variables from other packages. Additionally, special boolean variables
    `build`, `test` and `doc` are defined to allow limiting the scope of the
    dependency.

    * `build` dependencies are no longer needed at run-time: they won't trigger
      recompilations of your package.
    * `test` dependencies are only needed when building tests (_i.e._ by
      instructions in the [`build-test:`](#opamfield-build-test) field)
    * likewise, `doc` dependecies are only required when building the package
      documentation

- <a id="opamfield-depopts">
  `depopts: [ <string> { <filtered-package-formula> } ... ]`</a>:
  the package optional dependencies. This flag is similar to
  [`depends:`](#opamfield-depends) in format. It contains packages that will be
  _used_, if present, by the package being defined, either during build or
  runtime, but that are not _required_ for its installation. The implementation
  uses this information to define build order and trigger recompilations, but
  won't automatically install _depopts_ when installing the package.

    Variables in the filtered package formula are evaluated as for
    [`depends:`](#opamfield-depends).

    Note that `depopts: [ "foo" { = "3" } ]` means that the optional dependency
    only applies for `foo` version `3`, not that your package can't be installed
    with other versions of `foo`: for that, use the
    [`conflicts:`](#opamfield-conflicts) field.

- <a id="opamfield-conflicts">
  `conflicts: [ <string> { <version-constraint> } ... ]`</a>:
  a list of package names with optional version constraints indicating that the
  current package can't coexist with those.

- <a id="opamfield-depexts">
  `depexts: [ [ [ <string> ... ] [ <string> ... ] ] ... ]`</a>:
  the package external dependencies. This field is a list that can be used for
  describing the dependencies of the package toward software or packages
  external to the <span class="opam">opam</span> ecosystem, for various systems. It contains pairs of
  lists of the form `[ predicates ext-packages ]`. `predicates` is used to
  select the element of the list based on the current system: it is a list of
  tags (strings) that can correspond to the OS, architecture or distribution.
  The `predicates` is used as a conjunction: the pair will only be selected when
  _all_ tags are active. The resulting `ext-packages` should be identifiers of
  packages recognised by the system's package manager.

    There is currently no definite specification for the precise tags you should
    use, but the closest thing is the
    [opam-depext project](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-depext). The
    `depexts` information can be retrieved through the `opam list --external`
    command.

    The `depexts:` field should preferably be used on [`conf`](#opamflag-conf)
    packages, which make the dependencies clearer and avoids duplicating the
    efforts of documenting the appropriate system packages on the various
    OSes available.

- <a id="opamfield-messages">`messages: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  used to display an additional (one-line) message when prompting a solution
  implying the given package. A typical use-case is to tell the user that some
  functionality will not be available as some optional dependencies are not
  installed.

- <a id="opamfield-post-messages">
  `post-messages: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  allows to print specific messages to the user after the end of installation.
  The special boolean variable `failure` is defined in the scope of the filter,
  and can be used to print messages in case there was an error (typically, a
  hint on how it can be resolved, or a link to an open issue). `success` is also
  defined as syntactic sugar for `!failure`.

- <a id="opamfield-available">`available: [ <filter> ]`</a>:
  can be used to add constraints on the OS and other global variables.
  In case the filter doesn't evaluete to `true`, the package is disabled.

    This field is evaluated before request solving or any actions take place ;
    it can only refer to global variables, since it shouldn't depend on the
    current switch state. An unavailable package won't generally be seen on the
    system, except with `opam list -A`.

- <a id="opamfield-flags">`flags: [ <ident> ... ]`</a>:
  specify package flags that may alter package behaviour. Currently available
  flags are:

    - <a id="opamflag-light-uninstall">`light-uninstall`</a>:
      the package's uninstall instructions don't require
      the package source.
    - <a id="opamflag-verbose">`verbose`</a>:
      when this is present, the stdout of the package's build and
      install instructions will be printed to the user.
    - <a id="opamflag-plugin">`plugin`</a>:
      the package installs a program named `opam-<name>` and may be
      auto-installed and run with `opam <name>`.
      The convention is to name the plugin package `opam-<name>`.
    - <a id="opamflag-compiler">`compiler`</a>: the package is to be treated as
      a compiler, and will be advertised for installing as a `compiler` package
      when creating a fresh prefix through the `opam switch` command.
    - <a id="opamflag-conf">`conf`</a>: this is a "`conf`" package, that is
      intended to document capabilities of the system, or the presence of
      software installed outside of <span class="opam">opam</span>. As such, the package may not
      include a source URL or install anything, but just do some checks, and
      fail to install if they don't pass. `conf` packages should have a name
      starting with `conf-`, and include the appropriate
      [`depexts:`](#opamfield-depexts) field.

- <a id="opamfield-features">
  `features: [ <ident> <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a> (EXPERIMENTAL):
  this field is currently experimental and shouldn't be used on the main package
  repository. It allows to define custom variables that better document what
  _features_ are available in a given package build. Each feature is defined as
  an identifier, a documentation string, and a filter expression. The filter
  expression can evaluate to either a boolean or a string, and the defined
  identifier can be used as a variable in any filter (but recursive features are
  not allowed and will be _undefined_).

    This is typically useful to pass appropriate flags to `./configure` scripts,
    depending on what is installed.

- <a id="opamfield-synopsis">`synopsis: <string>`</a>:
  defines a short description (one line) for the package. This can also be
  defined as the first line of an external [`descr`](#descr) file.

- <a id="opamfield-description">`description: <string>`</a>:
  defines a long description (one or more paragraphs) for the package. This can
  also be defined as the body of an external [`descr`](#descr) file.

- <a id="opamsection-url">`url "{" <url-file> "}"`</a>:
  defines the URL where the package source can be obtained. This section has
  contents in the same format as the [`url`](#url) file, and has the same effect
  as using a separate `url` file.

- <a id="opamfield-setenv">`setenv: [ <environment-update> ... ]`</a>:
  defines environment variables updates that will be applied upon installing the
  package. The updates will be visible to any dependent package, as well as
  exported to the shell environment through `opam config env` and
  `~/.opam/opam-init/` scripts.

- <a id="opamfield-build-env">`build-env: [ <environment-update> ... ]`</a>:
  defines environment updates that will be applied when running the package's
  build, install and remove scripts.

- <a id="opamfield-extra-sources">`extra-sources: [ [ <string> { <string> } string ] ... ]`</a>:
  allows the definition of extra files that need downloading into the source tree
  before the package can be patched (if necessary) and built. The format is
  `[ "URL" { "checksum" } "filename" ]`, where `filename` is the target file,
  relative to the root of the source tree.

- <a id="opamfield-extra-files">`extra-files: [ [ <string> <string> ] ... ]`</a>:
  optionally lists the files below `files/` with their checksums. Used
  internally for integrity verifications.

- <a id="opamfield-extra-fields">`x-*:`</a>:
  extra fields prefixed with `x-` can be defined for use by external tools. <span class="opam">opam</span>
  will ignore them except for some search operations.

#### descr

Descr is a plain utf8 text file without specific syntactic constraints. The
first line of the file defines the package's synopsis, while the rest defines
its long description.

This information can be embedded in `opam` package definition files using the
[`synopsis:`](#opamfield-synopsis) and [`description:`](#opamfield-description)
fields since <span class="opam">opam</span> version 2.0. However, if a `descr` file is present alongside
the `opam` file, it takes precedence.

#### url

The `url` file describes the source of the package and how it may be obtained.
It has the following fields:

- One of <a id="urlfield-src">`src: <string>`</a> or
  <a id="urlfield-archive">`archive: <string>`</a>,
  specifying the URL where the package can be downloaded from. When using HTTP
  or FTP, this should be an archive. The older alternative field names
  <a id="urlfield-http">`http:`</a>,
  <a id="urlfield-local">`local:`</a>,
  <a id="urlfield-git">`git:`</a>,
  <a id="urlfield-hg">`hg:`</a> and
  <a id="urlfield-darcs">`darcs:`</a>
  are deprecated, prefer explicit URLs.

    On the official repository, this should always point to a stable archive
    over HTTP or FTP.
- <a id="urlfield-checksum">`checksum: <string>`</a>:
  the MD5 of the referred-to archive, to warrant integrity. Mandatory on the
  official repository.
- <a id="urlfield-mirrors">`mirrors: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  an optional list of mirrors. They must use the same protocol as the main URL.

These contents can be embedded within the [`url {}`](#opamsection-url) section
of an `opam` file; however, if an `url` file is present alongside the `opam`
file, its contents take precedence.

#### files/

A special subdirectory that can appear in package definition directories,
alongside the `opam` file.

This subdirectory may contain any files or directories (of reasonable size) that
will be copied over the root of the package source. [`opam`](#opam) file fields
like [`patches:`](#opamfield-patches) refer to files at that same root, so
patches specific to <span class="opam">opam</span> are typically included in this subdirectory.

Note that repository archives generated by `opam-admin make` in `archives/`
already include these overlay files.

#### <pkgname>.install
<a id="packagenameinstall"></a>

This file format describes the installation from a source directory to an
installation prefix. It will be used by <span class="opam">opam</span> if present in the package's source
directory after the `build:` instructions have been run: it can thus be
generated by the build system, be static in the package source, or be added by
<span class="opam">opam</span> through the [`files/`](#files) mechanism.

To avoid duplicating efforts for managing installations, a stand-alone
`opam-installer` tool is provided with <span class="opam">opam</span> that can perform installations and
uninstallations from these files, or even generate corresponding shell scripts,
without requiring <span class="opam">opam</span>.

All the fields have the form

```
field: [ <string> { <string> } ]
```

The following take a list of filenames (relative to the root of the package
source) to be installed to the field's respective directory. An optional
relative path and destination filename can be given using the postfix braces
syntax. A leading `?` in the origin filename is stripped and informs <span class="opam">opam</span> to
continue silently when the file is not found.

Absolute paths, or paths referencing the parent directory (`..`), are not
allowed.

- <a id="installfield-lib">`lib:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-libexec">`libexec:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/<pkgname>/`, but the `exec` bit is set (since
  <span class="opam">opam</span> 1.2.1)
- <a id="installfield-bin">`bin:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/bin/`, with the `exec` bit set
- <a id="installfield-sbin">`sbin:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/sbin/`, with the `exec` bit set
- <a id="installfield-toplevel">`toplevel:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/toplevel/`
- <a id="installfield-share">`share:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/share/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-share_root">`share_root:`</a>
  installs relative to `<prefix>/share/` (since <span class="opam">opam</span> 1.2.0)
- <a id="installfield-etc">`etc:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/etc/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-doc">`doc:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/doc/<pkgname>/`
- <a id="installfield-stublibs">`stublibs:`</a>
  installs to `<prefix>/lib/stublibs/`, with the `exec` bit set

The following are treated slightly differently:

- <a id="installfield-man">`man:`</a>
  installs relative to `<prefix>/man`, with the exception that when the
  destination is unspecified, the proper destination directory is extracted from
  the extension of the source file (so that `man: [ "foo.1" ]` is equivalent to
  `man: [ "foo.1" {"man1/foo.1"} ]`
- <a id="installfield-misc">`misc:`</a>
  requires files to specify an absolute destination, and the user will be
  prompted before the installation is done.

#### <pkgname>.config

This file is used by packages to give <span class="opam">opam</span> specific options upon
installation. A file with this name will be installed by <span class="opam">opam</span> into
`<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/config/` if found at the root of the package
source tree after its installation instructions have been run.

- <a id="dotconfigfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version.
- <a id="dotconfigfield-file-depends">`file-depends: [ "[" <string> <string> "]" ... ]`</a>:
  when a package defines `absolute-filename` - `hash` bindings using this field,
  on state-changing operations, <span class="opam">opam</span> will check that the file at the given path
  still exists and has the given hash. This can be used to guarantee the
  consistency of packages that rely on system-wide files or system packages when
  those are changed, _e.g._ by `apt-get upgrade`. The user will be warned if the
  file was removed, and the package marked for reinstallation if it was changed.
- <a id="dotconfigsection-variables">`variables: "{" { <ident>: <string> ... }
  "}"`</a>: allows the definition of package variables, that will be available
  as `<pkgname>:<varname>` to dependent packages.

### Local configuration files

These files are local to the opam root, and managed by <span class="opam">opam</span>. [`config`](#config)
and [`switch-config`](#switchconfig) can be manually edited to set configuration
options when <span class="opam">opam</span> isn't running. [`switch-state`](#switchstate) and
[`repos-config`](#reposconfig) store internal state and are documented here, but
shouldn't be edited except by <span class="opam">opam</span>.

#### config

This file is stored as `~/.opam/config` and defines global configuration options
for <span class="opam">opam</span>.

- <a id="configfield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the version of the format of this opam root, used in particular to trigger
  format migrations.
- <a id="configfield-repositories">`repositories: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  the set of configured repositories to use for newly created switches. The
  repositories themselves are set up using the
  [repos-config](#reposconfigfield-repositories) file.
- <a id="configfield-installed-switches">`installed-switches: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  lists the switches configured in this opam root, either internal or local.
  Deleted local switches are collected by <span class="opam">opam</span> automatically, and it is possible
  to use local switches that are not recorded in this field. It remains useful
  for cross-switch listings, repository configuration updates, or <span class="opam">opam</span> format
  migrations.
- <a id="configfield-switch">`switch: <string>`</a>:
  the currently globally selected switch.
- <a id="configfield-jobs">`jobs: <int>`</a>:
  the number of concurrent jobs to run for build processes.
- <a id="configfield-download_jobs">`download_jobs: <int>`</a>:
  the maximum number of concurrent downloads.
- <a id="configfield-download-command">`download-command: [ ( <string> | <ident> ) { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the command to use for downloading packages. If set to a single element, will
  use the `curl` and `wget` presets if set to those idents, and use the named
  executable with a curl-compatible command-line otherwise. Should otherwise be
  a full command, and in this scope, the following variables are defined:
    - `url` is the remote URL to fetch from
    - `out` is the expected output file
    - `retry` is the number of retries allowed
    - `compress` is whether HTTP compression should be enabled
    - `checksum` is the expected checksum of the file
- <a id="configfield-solver-criteria">`solver-criteria: <string>`</a>: can be
  used to tweak the solver criteria used for the resolution of operations. These
  depend on the external solver used, see the
  [Solver Criteria](Specifying_Solver_Preferences.html) page for details.
- <a id="configfield-solver-upgrade-criteria">`solver-upgrade-criteria: `</a>,
  <a id="configfield-solver-fixup-criteria">`solver-fixup-criteria: `</a>:
  similar to [`solver-criteria`](#configfield-solver-criteria), but specific to
  some actions.
- <a id="configfield-solver">`solver: [ ( <string> | <ident> ) { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  the external solver command to use. See the
  [External Solvers](Install.html#ExternalSolvers) section of the install guide
  for context. If set to a single `<ident>` element, that may point to one of
  the `aspcud`, `packup` or `mccs` predefined command-lines. Otherwise, the
  following variables are defined in the command scope:
    - `input` is the name of the input file, in [Cudf](http://mancoosi.org/cudf/) format
    - `output` is the expected name of the output file, containing the solution
    - `criteria` is the defined solver criteria.
- <a id="configfield-global-variables">`global-variables: [ "[" <ident> ( <string> | <bool> ) <string> "]" ... ]`</a>:
  allows the definition of global variables. The last `<string>` is for
  documentation and is shown in the output of `opam config list`.
- <a id="configfield-eval-variables">`eval-variables: [ "[" <ident> [ <string> ... ] <string> "]" ... ]`</a>:
  allows the definition of global variables that will be lazily initialised to
  the output of the given command. The last `<string>` documents the variable.
- <a id="configfield-pre-build-commands">`pre-build-commands: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-pre-install-commands">`pre-install-commands: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-pre-remove-commands">`pre-remove-commands: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] ... ]`</a>:
  specify commands that will be run just before processing the package's commands
  for the corresponding action, on any package. The filters are evaluated in the
  same scope as the package commands.
- <a id="configfield-wrap-build-commands">`wrap-build-commands: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-wrap-install-commands">`wrap-install-commands: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-wrap-remove-commands">`wrap-remove-commands: [ <string> { <filter> } ... ]`</a>:
  specify wrappers around every command executed during the corresponding action
  of any package. The command-line elements will be prefixed to the package
  command, so for example command `[ make "install" ]` with wrapper
  `[ "time" "-o" "/tmp/timings" "-a" ]` will result in the command
  `[ "time" "-o" "/tmp/timings" "-a" make "install" ]`.
  The filters are evaluated in the same scope as the package commands.
- <a id="configfield-post-build-commands">`post-build-commands: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-post-install-commands">`post-install-commands: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] ... ]`</a>,
  <a id="configfield-post-remove-commands">`post-remove-commands: [ [ <string> { <filter> } ... ] ... ]`</a>:
  specify commands that will be run just after processing the package's commands
  for the corresponding action, and the `<pkgname>.install` file in the case of
  install and remove, on any package. The post commands are run wether or not
  the package script succeeded. The filters are evaluated in the same scope as
  the package commands, with the addition of the variable `error-code`, which is
  the return value of the package script.

#### switch-state

This file, located at `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/switch-state`, is used by
<span class="opam">opam</span> to store the current state of a switch. All fields are lists of packages
specified as strings in the format `<package>.<version>`.

- <a id="switchstatefield-opam-version">`opam-version: <string>`</a>:
  the file format version.
- <a id="switchstatefield-compiler">`compiler: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  the package that form the base of the current switch. They won't be affected
  by `opam upgrade`, and are protected against deletion.
- <a id="switchstatefield-roots">`roots: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  lists the package "roots", _i.e._ packages that have been installed manually
  by the user (as opposed to the ones which got installed to fulfil
  dependencies). Note that packages in this list may not be installed, if they
  were removed due to build failures.
- <a id="switchstatefield-installed">`installed: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  lists all currently installed packages.
- <a id="switchstatefield-pinned">`pinned: [ <string> ... ]`</a>:
  lists all packages which have been pinned, and to what version. If an overlay
  package definition is present in
  `<switch-prefix>/.opam-switch/overlay/<pkgname>/`, that can be used to alter
  the package definition and modify its source URL. Otherwise, the package is
  simply pinned to the given version.

#### repos-config

This file is at `~/.opam/repo/repos-config` and lists all package repositories
configured on the system, and their source URLs.

- <a id="reposconfigfield-repositories">`repositories: [ <string> { <URL> } ... ]`</a>:
  lists the configured repository idents and their URLs.

Note that repositories without URLs can be used. In that case, the data in the
corresponding directory will be used but never updated by <span class="opam">opam</span> ; also, caching
will be disabled for that repository, so that manual modifications will always
be taken into account.
